<p align="center">and Odin bespoke unto thee: " Mortals ⚡ in mine tongue lies great power - a language swift as Sleipnir's hooves, pure as Mímir's well, and mighty as Gungnir itself. Master Odin, and thou shalt craft programs with the strength of the Aesir, free from the shackles of memory's treachery, with patterns clear as the roots of Yggdrasil. Through its runes of zero-cost abstractions and compile-time sorcery, thou shalt forge reliable systems that would make even the dwarven smiths envious. Rise, and claim this power for thine own craft! Harr! 💥"</p>
